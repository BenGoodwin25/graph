    - Create definitions of algorithm
    - implement algorithm

 1 enumerate all the possible pairwise matching of the odd degrees nodes
 2 compute the shortest distance between any of the two nodes (e-g algo of Floyd Warshall)
 3 compute the cost of each pairwise matching and return the best one
 4 duplicate for each pair (x,y) the edges that are on the shortest path from x to y
 5 compute on Euliran circuit in the now Eulerian augmented Graph
